#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
software engineering involves identifying problems in the real world and providing solutions to the problems by use of computer.
It includes the following steps:
                   Designing-This is where you identify a problem and how it can be solved.
                   Developing-You work on the problem by creating the appropriate software.
                   Test-test how the software works.
                   Deplo-Put the software into action.
                   Maintenance-Keep the software updated.
therefore software engineering is about developing applications and systems that can be used to run various aspects of the industry.                   


Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
    a)  Early Programming
In this codiing was done directly in machine language  i.e  0s and 1s 
    b)  Object Oriented Programmiing
This include languages like c++ and Java
It made it easy to design complex software systems by promoting code reuse and easy to manage and run code.
    c)  Artificial Inteligence Software Engineering
AI is integrated into software development tools, helping automate tasks like code generation, testing and bug fixing.
AI makes software development more efficient, helping developers create better software and with fewer errors.


List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
planning- Define the projects objective.
Requirements analysis- Gather and analyse specific requirementsof the software understanding what the user needs.
Design- create the architecture and design the software, detailing how itwill work and look.
Impementation- translate the design into actual code by writing the software.
Testing- Ensure the software works as expected and free from defects.
Deployment- Release the software to users in the production enviroment.
Maintenance- keep the software as needed.


Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
waterfall methodology is a sequential process while agile methodology id an iterative process.
In waterfall methodology eachphase must be complete before the next begins while in  iterative process the project is divided into multiple parts(sprints) which are presentet to the user after completion,they are easily changed to suit the user's requirements.
waterfall methodology is appropriate where the requirements are are unlikely to change while  Agile methodology is better when building new app,it can be split into pieces and done separately.



Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
    a)  Software Developer
Role: Is responsible for designing,coding and implementing software applications according to the project's requirements
Responsibilities:Writing code. Develops the actual software by writing code.
                 Designing solutions. works on the software design and architecture creating solutions that meet the project's requirements
                 Debugging and troubleshooting. Identifies and fixes issues in the code.
                 Testing. tests the functionality of the code.
                 Code review. Goes throu the code again if an error was fount while testing.
                 Collaboration with the team. Interacts with couleagues  concerning the codes.
    b)  Quality assurance Engineer  
 Role: Ensures the software is of high quality and meets the specified requirements by systematically testing it.
 Responsibilities:Creating test plans.Develops detailed test plans based on the software requirements.
                  Writing test cases. Create specific test cases that will be used to check the functionality of the software.
                  Manual and automated testing. Executes manual tests or usesd automated testing tools for the functionality of the software.
                  Identfying defects. Identifies issues with the software and communicates the problem to the software developer fo correction.
                  Regression testing. tests the software again after correction.
                  Ensuaring compliance. Ensures the software meets the requirements of the users.
                  providing feedback. communicates the functionality of the software to the software developer and manager
    c)  Project manager
  Role: Oversees the entire software evelopment process,ensuring that the project is completed on time,within budget and satisfaction of the stakeholder.
  Responsibilities:Project planning. Define the objective, scope, timeline and budget.
                   Resourse management. Allocates resources.
                   Team coordinatio. Facilitates communication and collaboration between developers.
                   Risk management. Identifies potential risks and develop strategies to mitigate them.
                   Monitoring progress. tracks the project's progress against the plan.
                   Stakeholder communication. Provides update of the project's status.
                   Final delivering. delivers the final outcome to the stakeholder.


Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
    a)  IDEs
  Efficiency. IDEs provide features like code completion, syntax highlighting and error detection.
  e.g vitual studiocode suggests the correct function and its usage when one starts to type a function.
  Debugging. IDEs come with built in debugging tools thet help developers find and fix bugs in code by running the code step by step.
  e.g In pycharm, one can use a debugger to pause the program at specific ponts.
  Project management. IDEs hel manage multiple files and libraris that are part of the software project.
  e.g Eclipse for java lets you organise all your classes,libraries and resourses in one place.

   b)  Version Control
  Tracking changes. VCS keeps a history of all cgamges made to the code.
  e.g Using Git, if a new bug is introduced after the latest changes you can use the 'Git diff' command to see changes.
  Collaboration. VCS allows multiple developers to work on the same code without overwritting each other's work. They can do different parts then merge.
  e.g Team using GitHub, each deeloper can work on a feature branch, ones ready create a 'pull request' to merge the changes.
  Backup. VCS serves as a backup for your project. one can alwas retrieve lost files from the latest VCS.
  e.g If your computer crushes and lose your project files,you can clone the project from GitHub.


What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
    a) Merging complexity
  review code regularly with peers to see otential issues.
    b) Keeping up with rapidly changing technology
  Dedicate time to learn new technology
    c) Time management and meeting deadlines
  Allocate each task a specific time.
    d) Communication and collaboration
  hold regular stand-up meetings.
    e) Handling ambiguous requirements
  communicate with users to clarify and confirm requirements.
    f) Maintaining work-life balance
  establish boundaries between work and personal time.

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
 Unit testing - testing individual components to ensure they work as intended.
                It catches bugs early in the deveopment process.
 Integration testing -Tests how different modules in the software work together.
                Ensures the interactionbetween integarated modules work as expected.
 System testing -tests the whole system to verify that it meets the specified requirements.
                Ensures the components work together and the system functions correctly.
 Acceptance testing -it validates the software,ensuring that it meets the business requirements and is ready for use.               


#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
Prompt Engineering is about how one structures questions or instructions to an AI to get the best response that suits the context.
It makes it easy for the AI to give the user the response that he/she needs.


Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
  a) What is software Engineering.
  b) What are the basics of software engineering,explain using simple terms for a beginner.

  the second question is more effective because naw the AI gets specificly what the user wants and simlifies the answer to a much easier and understandable answer to a beginner.
